# jwt-structure
an implementation of the jwt structure in the golang programming language can use a secret key to encode or decode jwt 
we can use a header and payload with a secret key to generate an encrypted token
 and save it to a cookie and then use this token with a secret key that exists in the server application to validate the signature part. After that,  
 is everything okay? We can show information to the user.
